# Robo Girl - Your Virtual Assistant

## Overview
**Robo Girl** is a voice-activated virtual assistant designed to respond to user commands using speech recognition and synthesis. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this assistant listens to user input and can perform actions such as opening websites, playing music, or responding to inquiries. The assistant was created by **Vaishnavi Shinde**.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Robo Girl listens to user commands through the browser's microphone.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Provides spoken feedback for user commands.
- **Command Execution**: Can open websites (e.g., YouTube, Google), perform Google searches, and respond with pre-programmed answers.
- **Dynamic Microphone Button**: The microphone button reappears after the assistant processes a command, allowing continuous interaction.

## Technologies Used
